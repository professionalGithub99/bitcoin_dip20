send btc over layer1 to icp canister
first show the btc on icp balance is 0
open the invoice and send btc
show we made it need 6 confirmations to be transacted 
that means show with 1 and no balance deposited
then do the 5 + more 
show btc on icp balance is still 0 till after you close the invoice

show that btc sent to icp is 1:1 besides the fee it takes
send the btc on icp around to many other users/principals
transact out the btc to a completely new l1 address 
spam transactions over the btconicp canister and show how little the fees are
   we note with reverse gas model users can literally pay feeless bitcoin if you subsidize the ledger canister in some other indirect method instead of a tx fee
show that btc on icp transactions care not about the block time on btc but the block time on icp
first show the cycles before the spam
then show cycles after spam


Finally
emphasize this point: 
once btc is sent to a canister its icp's network becomes a trustless intermediary for trading bitcoin while subjecting yourself to its network security speed and decentralization

in essence the speed,security, and trustlessness of btc on the icp network is a lower bound of icp's network 

so if you believe in icp's network then theres no need to worry that a canister is being used to issue a btc over the icp network
